Why Do We Study Character Animation
• A character typically has 20+ joints, or 50-100+ parameters
• It is not super high-dimensional, so most animation can be created manually, 
by posing the character at keyframes
• Labor-intensive, not for interactive applications
• Character animation techniques
• Understanding the mechanism behind motions and behaviors
• Smart editing of animation/ Reuse animation / Generate new animation
• “Compute-intensive”
